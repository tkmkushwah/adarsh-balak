                Lorem Ipsum
                is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a
                series of real

            <p>Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of
            dummy text is nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance:
            human perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution of letters and
            'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and
            readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout or type area). For this
            reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
            patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates the comparison of different typefaces.
            Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout impression of the final
            publication is not compromised.</p>

            <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2 ">Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question.</h1>
            <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum
            is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real
            Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in
            Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does
            not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.</p>
